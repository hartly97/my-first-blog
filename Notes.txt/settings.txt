When DEBUG is True and ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty, the host is validated against ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]']. This won't match our hostname on PythonAnywhere once we deploy our application so we will change the following setting:
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', '<your_username>.pythonanywhere.com']
